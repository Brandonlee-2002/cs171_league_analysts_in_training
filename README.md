## Project Name: League Analysts in Training

## Description of Topic

We are looking to create a model that can predict the winner of the biggest League of Legends tournament every year: The World Championships. We plan to use data from matches this summer for the participating teams in their perspective regions. We will only be looking at the teams that have qualified to this year's worlds only because each year the team composition meta always changes each year by Riot Games to keep the game fresh. This data includes gold differential@15 min, CS (creep score), KDA (kill, death, ratio), and more (not sure what other data to use right now).

## 

## Data Collection

Riot Games API key, Publicly Curated Sites of Match Records (spreadsheets)

## 

## Model Plans

Test a variety of models to see which model works best for this type of project. Very ambitious project considering the timeline but this is a passion project as well so we would love to succeed in this project!

## 

## Project timeline

Week 1/2 - Collect all the data from this year, start working on filtering the data to keep the data that we need only to run models



Week 3 - Start testing models to see which model is the best for our project



Week 4 - Finalize 2 models and start running the training and testing models, predict with live matches and try to see how the model predicts their outcome



Week 5/6 - Enjoy worlds while working on homework!



Week 7/8 - Work on presentation
