    "### This notebook will cover our usages of KNN and KMeans model to classify League of Legends characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is about using machine learning models to predict a characters ranking based off of their strength in a patch.\n",
    "A patch is essentially an update applied to the game by the developers in order to keep the game feeling fresh. \n",
    "They target the strength of the champions and items, adjusting it to make the game more even for every character. \n",
    "Our models analyze data published by Riot Games in order to create strength rankings for a set of patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of ranks is to try and categorize the strength of the numerous characters in the game. It gets the point across to a reader on which character is better or worse. This leads to the idea of \"meta,\" short for \"Most Effect Tactic Available.\" Due to the nature of competitive games, players often aim to get an advantage on each other in order to win a match. This is commonly done by playing the strongest character on the patch. The idea of playing stronger characters also applies to pro-players in the world of esports, where they compete in various tournaments and leagues to earn money and a chance to compete internationally. Our aim with these models is to create intuitive rankings to help players decide on which characters are the best in a patch."
